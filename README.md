# AI_ML-TASK_5
# Task 5: Model Deployment and Prediction

This notebook is part of my AI & ML internship.  
In this task, I focused on using a trained machine learning model to make predictions and demonstrate how it can be applied to new data.

## Dataset Used
- [Specify dataset name here, e.g., Titanic, Iris, etc.]
- Provide dataset source if available (Kaggle, UCI, etc.)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## What I Did
- Loaded the dataset and prepared it for prediction.
- Used a trained model (created in previous tasks or retrained here).
- Performed necessary preprocessing on input data.
- Generated predictions using the model.
- Visualized prediction results using matplotlib.
- Discussed potential real-world use cases of the model.

## What I Learned
- How to use a trained ML model for making predictions.
- The importance of matching preprocessing steps for training and prediction.
- How to present and interpret prediction results.
- Considerations for deploying a model in real-world scenarios.

This task helped me understand the final step of an ML pipelineâ€”using a model to make actionable predictions.  
Feel free to check out the notebook and suggest improvements!
